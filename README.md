# trigger-mybinder-build

[![Actions Status](https://github.com/s-weigand/trigger-mybinder-build/workflows/Tests/badge.svg)](https://github.com/s-weigand/trigger-mybinder-build/actions)

Github action to trigger a build on [binder](https://mybinder.org/),
so the build is always up to date with the targeted state and users don't have to wait.

## Use with care

Since [binder](https://mybinder.org/) is an none profit project, please use this action sparsely and
in a none spammy manner, to treat their resources with care.
An example would be a repository, where the branch which should be build is only changed via pull requests
and this action is only executed on that branch.
To not spam [binder](https://mybinder.org/) is also why, by design, `target-repo` is a required
input and not read from the environment, since this prevents unnecessary builds of forks.
